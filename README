Diablo (Diablo Is A Better Link-time Optimizer) is a retargetable link-time
binary rewriting framework. While our focus has been mostly on program
compaction and software protection, binary rewriting has a much broader range of
applications: speed optimizations, power consumption optimizations, size
optimizations, watermarking, instrumentation, etc.

A good binary rewriting framework (one like Diablo :-)) is also very useful for
program analysis and understanding. For instance, Diablo can print out the
control flow graph for all functions in a program, annotated with for example
liveness information.

Lately Diablo has been used in the ASPIRE project to develop a number of
software protection techniques, the code of which can be found in the aspire
subdirectory.
